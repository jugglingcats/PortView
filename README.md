Tiny Windows application to monitor when virtual serial devices are added to and removed from the system.

By default displays as an always-on-top semi-transparent window. Blinks when devices are added or removed.

Double-click the task tray icon to give the window a border and allow you to move/resize the window. Double-click again to go semi-transparent.

On the right click menu of the task tray icon you can:

- Toggle floating mode (same as double-click behaviour)
- Toggle always-on-top mode (only applies when not in floating mode)
- Reset devices. Rescans devices in case the list gets corrupted somehow
- Exit the app
